To perform 3 task
1)Create a machine learning model that can predict the genre of a movie based on its plot summary or other textual information. You can use techniques like TF-IDF or wordembeddings with classifierssuch as Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, or Support VectorMachines.
2)Build a model to detect fraudulent credit card transactions. Use a dataset containing information about credit card transactions, and experiment with algorithms like Logistic
Regression, Decision Trees, or Random Forests to classify transactions as fraudulent or legitimate.
3)Build an AI model that can classify SMS messages as spam or legitimate. Use techniques like TF-IDF or word embeddings with classifiers like Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, or Support Vector Machines to identify spam messages.
